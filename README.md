University Networking project using Cisco packet tracer
We are trying to make a university network using Cisco packet tracer .our
first target is to collect basic data for the network .then we will try to implement the network part wise.Next we will try to modify our network into
a proper university network with few departments ,cloud server, smtp ,ftp
server using dynamic and static routing protocol along with some iot devices
.as we haven’t done much and some area of the Cisco software are still new to
us that’s why we are unable to provide much information about our project.
